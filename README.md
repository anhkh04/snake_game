# Snake Game 🐍

## 1. Introduction
This is a classic Snake game built in C++ that runs in the terminal. The objective of the game is to control the snake, collect food, and grow in length while avoiding 
collisions itself. Your highest score will be automatically saved to a file named output.txt.

## 2. How to play
At the start, the snake consists of a head, represented by 'O', and a body, represented by 'o'. The fruit is symbolized by '*'.
The snake moves automatically. To change its direction use the W, A, S, D keys:
- W → Move up
- A → Move left
- S → Move down
- D → Move right

The fruit remains on the board until eaten. Your goal is to guide the snake to eat the fruit. Each time the snake eats a fruit:
- Its length increases.
- The speed of the snake will increase.
- Your score increases by 10 points.
- A new fruit appears at a different position on the board.

<mark>The only way to lose the game is if the snake collides with itself. So, navigate carefully and have fun!</mark>
